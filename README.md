## 📖 How It Works

### The Health Score

Your score (0-100) answers one question: *"Is my financial system resilient?"*

**Score Components:**
- **Emergency Buffer (40%)** — Months of expenses in cash
- **Debt Management (30%)** — Debt as % of annual income
- **Financial Growth (20%)** — Investment buffer in years
- **Cashflow Health (10%)** — Savings rate

### The 5 Tiers

- **90-100: Thriving 🟢** — Exceptional financial health
- **75-89: Strong 🟡** — Solid position, keep it up
- **60-74: Stable 🟠** — Good foundation, room to grow
- **40-59: Stressed 🔴** — System is strained, focus needed
- **0-39: Critical ⚫** — Immediate action required

## 📱 Installing on Your Phone

1. Open in **Safari** (must be Safari!)
2. Tap Share button → "Add to Home Screen"
3. Tap "Add"

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

**Each family member's data is separate** — you're using the same app, but data doesn't sync between devices.

## 💡 Usage Tips

- Clearing browser data = losing your data
- Factory reset = losing your data
- Each device has separate data

**PIN Security:**
- If you forget your PIN, you'll need to clear browser data and start over
- PIN is hashed (SHA-256), cannot be recovered
